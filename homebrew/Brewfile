# Note
# from https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle
#
# Homebrew does not support installing specific versions of a library,
# only the most recent one, so there is no good mechanism for storing installed versions in a .lock file.
# If your software needs specific versions then perhaps you'll want
# to look at using Vagrant to better match your development and production environments.
