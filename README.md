# Mauricio Poppe's dotfiles

[![travis](https://travis-ci.org/maurizzzio/dotfiles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/maurizzzio/dotfiles)
![platform osx](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-osx-orange.svg)

## Features

- Installation fully automated with a simple [script](https://github.com/maurizzzio/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/dotfiles)
- Install only what you need e.g. if you want to test my NeoVim configuration just execute `dotfiles neovim`

## Requirements

- XCode Command Line Tools, if you don't have it install it with `$ xcode-select --install`
- ZSH (installed by default on OSX)

## Installation

```sh
curl -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maurizzzio/dotfiles/master/install.sh -o $TMPDIR/install.sh && source $TMPDIR/install.sh
```

The script above clones the repository to `~/.dotfiles`, in addition the `bin/` directory will be added to your path for the current session

All operations are done through the `dotfiles` script

```
$ dotfiles --help
```

| Important notes about the installer |
| ---- |
| make sure you read the `install.zsh` script and the README file included on each directory before executing `$ dotfiles [folder]` |
| executing `$ dotfiles [folder]` might symlink some files of this repo to your dotfiles, this script makes a backup of your existing dotfiles with the name `[name].backup` |

For example if you want to install my configuration of tmux execute

```
$ dotfiles tmux
```

Which calls the `install.zsh` script located inside the folder `tmux/`, you
can do this with all the first level directories of this repo e.g. `$ dotfiles
[zsh|tmux|neovim|...]`

You can also install the triumvirate (zsh + tmux + neovim) with a single command

```
dotfiles essential
```

Additionally you can install brew formulas, applications, node.js/python global
packages and alfred workflows with

```
dotfiles complete
```

  i.e. without using hjkl)

  - list of all jumps `:jumps`
- Scroll Forward/Backward `<c-f>`, `<c-b>`
- Moving between paragraphs `<shift-{`, `<shift-}>`
- In a splat line `g-hjkl`

Useful remaps
- Copy/paste to system clipboard `<Space>y`, `<Space>p`
- `<Escape>` is remapped in insert mode to `jk` or `kj`

Spell checking
- Cycle through misspelled words: `]s`, `[s`
- On a misspelled word get suggestions: `z=`

Plugins
- Git wrapper (tpope/vim-fugitive), `:Git, :Gstatus, :Gread, :GWrite`
  - `:Gstatus` cheatsheet http://vimcasts.org/episodes/fugitive-vim-working-with-the-git-index/
- Visual selection (terryma/vim-expand-region)
  - `v` expands the selection
  - `<c-v>` shrinks the selection
- Fast movement with (easymotion/vim-easymotion) `<Space><Space>` plus some basic movement
  - `<Space><Space>w` move forward to some next word
  - `<Space><Space>b` move backward to some previous word
  - `<Space><Space>s` search a single character
  - `<Space><Space>fo` find the character `o` forward

  - `gcc` comments a line
  - `4gcc` comments the following 4 lines (including the current line)
  - `gcap` comments a paragraph
- Multiple cursors (terryma/vim-multiple-cursors)
  - `<c-n>` to highlight the current word, pressing it again finds the next occurrence and places another virtual cursor
  - `<c-p>` remove the current virtual cursor and go back to the previous virtual cursor location
- Sessions (xolox/vim-sessions)
  - When working on a specific project save the session by executing in command line mode `:SaveSession name`
  - Restore a session `:OpenSesssion name` or `:OpenSession` to get the list of saved sessions
  - Sessions are saved inside `~/.vim/sessions/{name}` to make `tmux-resurrect` restore the session properly initialize vim with `vim -S ~/.vim/sessions/{name}`
