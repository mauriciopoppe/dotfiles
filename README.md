# Mauricio Poppe's dotfiles

[![travis](https://travis-ci.org/maurizzzio/dotfiles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/maurizzzio/dotfiles)
![platform osx](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-osx-orange.svg)

## Features

- Installation fully automated with a simple [script](https://github.com/maurizzzio/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/dotfiles)
- Install only what you need e.g. if you want to test my Neovim configuration execute `dotfiles neovim`

## Requirements

- XCode Command Line Tools, if you don't have it install it with `$ xcode-select --install`
- ZSH (installed by default on OSX)

## Installation

```sh
curl -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maurizzzio/dotfiles/master/install.sh -o $TMPDIR/install.sh && source $TMPDIR/install.sh
```

The script above clones the repository to `~/.dotfiles`, in addition the `bin/` directory will be added to your path for the current session

All operations are done through the `dotfiles` script

```
$ dotfiles --help
```

| Important notes about the installer |
| ---- |
| make sure you read the `install.zsh` script and the README file included on each directory before executing `$ dotfiles [folder]` |
| executing `$ dotfiles [folder]` might symlink some files of this repo to your dotfiles, this script makes a backup of your existing dotfiles with the name `[name].backup` |

For example if you want to install my configuration of tmux execute

```
$ dotfiles tmux
```

Which calls the `install.zsh` script located inside the folder `tmux/`, you
can do this with all the first level directories of this repo e.g. `$ dotfiles
[zsh|tmux|neovim|...]`

You can also install the triumvirate (zsh + tmux + neovim) with a single command

```
dotfiles essential
```

Additionally you can install brew formulas, applications, node.js/python global
packages and alfred workflows with

```
dotfiles complete
```

### Post installation

- Uncheck *use lion-style full screen* on General

## What's included? And how to customize?

Refer to the file `install.zsh` that each folder has, after cloning the repo you
