# Mauricio Poppe's dotfiles

![platform macos](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-macOS-orange.svg)
![platform linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-linux-blue.svg)

## Features

- Installation fully automated with a simple [script](https://github.com/mauriciopoppe/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/bin/dotfiles)
- Install only what you need e.g. if you want to test my Neovim configuration execute `dotfiles neovim`

## Requirements

### MacOS

- XCode Command Line Tools, if you don't have it install it with `xcode-select --install`
- zsh (installed by default on OSX)

### Linux

- zsh

## Installation

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/mauriciopoppe/dotfiles .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
source install.sh
```

The script above will add `~/.dotfiles/zsh/bin/` to your `PATH` for the current session

All operations are done through the `dotfiles` script

```
dotfiles --help
```

| Important notes about the installer |
| ---- |
| make sure you read the `install.zsh` script and the README file included on each directory before executing `$ dotfiles <command>` |
| executing `$ dotfiles <command>` might symlink some files of this repo to your dotfiles, this script makes a backup of already existing files as `[name].backup` |

For example if you want to install my configuration of tmux execute

```
dotfiles tmux
```

Which calls the `install.zsh` script located inside the `tmux/` folder, you
can do this with all the first level directories of this repo e.g. `$ dotfiles
[zsh|tmux|neovim|...]`

### Post installation

- Remap <kbd>caps lock</kbd> to <kbd>control</kbd> *preferences > keyboard > modifier keys*
- Install a patched font from [nerd fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) (I'm currently using *Inconsolata go*)

#### iTerm 2

- Install the profiles located at `@macos/iTerm2/Profiles.json`, *iTerm > preferences > profiles > import JSON profiles*

- Set the downloaded font on iTerm *iTerm > preferences > profiles > text* (change it for both regular and non-ascii fonts)
- Uncheck *use lion-style full screen* on General
- Support italic fonts in and out of tmux https://github.com/nicknisi/dotfiles#terminal-capabilities

```
tic -x zsh/term/xterm-256color-italic.terminfo
```

## What's included? And how to customize it?

Refer to the file `install.zsh` that each folder has, after cloning the repo you
can add whatever you need inside each installation script
